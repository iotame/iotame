# iotame: Taming the Internet of Things

Home automation that doesn't require a manual. Visual flows, instant setup, endless possibilities.

## Core principles
- **Intuitive by design**: Home automation should feel natural, not like solving puzzles. iotame focuses on visual workflows and clear interfaces that make sense at first glance. We design for clarity and predictability. Everything should be obvious, discoverable and work the way you expect it to.
- **Built for everyone**: Whether you're setting up your first smart light or building complex multi-device automations: iotame grows with your needs. Users get drag-and-drop simplicity for common tasks, while developers get powerful TypeScript tools for advanced integrations. Great user experience means both casual users and power users can achieve their goals effectively.
- **Zero-friction deployment**: Getting started shouldn't take a whole weekend. iotame ships as a single binary<sup>(&ast;)</sup> with everything included: No dependency hunting, no complex installation procedures, no environment setup. Download, run, automate. When deployment is simple, you spend time on automations, not infrastructure.  
  <sup>(&ast;)</sup> <sub>_Requires [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh) for the plugin ecosystem. iotame takes care of installing this for you in most cases_</sub>
- **Reliable by architecture**: iotame's core prioritizes stability and predictable behavior with isolated plugin execution and automatic recovery systems. Your lights should turn on every time, your security should never fail, and your automations should work consistently whether the system has been running for hours or months.

## Current status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development**: iotame is in active development and not yet ready for production use. We're building the foundation and core architecture. Interested in following along or contributing? Star the repo and check back as we build something better.

## Getting involved

This project is just getting started, but the vision is clear: home automation that works for humans, not the other way around. If you're frustrated with current solutions or excited about building something better, we'd love to have you along for the journey.
